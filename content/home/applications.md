Here are some of the things I've built and deployed so far:

- [Pulser](pulser-beta.herokuapp.com):
	Presentation apps still adhere to a paradigm of one-way communication. This leads to boredom, audience disengagement, and death by Powerpoint. 

	Pulser is different. By providing for two way communication and real time audience feedback, Pulser allows a presenter to invite audience participation. This facilitates communications, and allows a presenter to understand her audience.

	Built with Knex/Postgres, Express, React/Redux, Node, and Sockets.io
- [Food Runner](food-runner2.herokuapp.com:): 
	A crowdsourced, task-sharing app with a built in 'karma' system.

	Built with Mongo, Express, React, and Node.
- [On Foot](onf00t.herokuapp.com:):: 
	A geolocation app that shows you only the cheapest, highest rated restaurants within walking distance.

	Built with HTML5, React, Express, and Node.
